Health Insurance Cost Predictive Model

My Health Insurance Cost Prediction Model Project centers around a user-friendly GUI Predictive Model built with Tkinter. 

Utilizing MACHINE LEARNING principles to learn from historical data, a process that involves evaluating various algorithms
to select and combine the best performing four regression models for enhanced accuracy, this model effectively predicts charges for new customers in the health insurance sector. 

Users simply input six key details, including: 
1-Age, 
2-Gender (Male/Female - represented as 1 for male, 0 for female),
3-Number of Children, 
4-Smoker Status (Yes/No - represented as 1 for yes, 0 for no), 
5-Body Mass Index (BMI - a measure relating weight to height), and 
6-Region (represented as 1-4 for different geographical areas), and the model provides an immediate CHARGE estimation.

Advantages of this Model:
 > For Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs):
   - Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Streamlines the customer onboarding process by automating charge estimation, significantly reducing manual effort and processing time.
   - Improved Risk Assessment & Underwriting: Provides data-driven insights into potential customer costs, enabling more accurate premium setting and better financial planning.
   - Competitive Advantage: Equips HMOs with a modern, innovative tool that can lead to more competitive service offerings and improved market positioning.
   - Data-Driven Decision Making: Supports strategic business decisions by providing reliable forecasts based on historical data patterns.
 > For Clients (New Customers):
   - Increased Transparency & Trust: Offers clear, upfront estimation of potential charges, eliminating ambiguity and building greater confidence in the health insurance process.
   - Empowered Decision-Making: Enables clients to understand and plan for their healthcare costs before committing, resulting in more informed choices about their insurance coverage.
   - Faster Service: Reduces waiting times for quotes, providing immediate information on estimated costs.
